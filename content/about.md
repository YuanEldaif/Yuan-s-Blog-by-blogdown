This is a test website for my blog by using [**R blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yuan Du](https://github.com/YuanEldaif). You may find my name as Alice, Yoanna and last name as Eldaif as I recently got married.:scream_cat: Sorry for so many names that causes confusions...



I'm a Biostatistician in AdventHealth based in Orlando, FL. The more I work, the more I realized that I need to learn more statistics and data science. With a curious mind and always looking for growth, I decided to pusure my PHD in big data to refresh my knowledage and continue to learn systematically. This is my test blog that contains topics in Statitics, Data Science,etc.
