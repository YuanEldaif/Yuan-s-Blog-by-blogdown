Thanks to the short course at SDSS 2019, I learned how to do tf-idf to topic modeling and sentiment analysis by using tidytext taught by Julia Silge, author of [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) and Mara Averick. They did a great job on teaching the four hour class. I didn't expect to have so much covered in the short course. 

Here is an example that I used the method to analyze__.

#Installation

`install.packages("tidytext")`
