I'm a noobie on using Github and Hugo. :blush: It took me quite a while to figure out how to use version control on Github through Rstudio. In this blog, I would like to share my hickhups on publishing website to Github and deploy my website by Netflify. Some of the hickhups were caused by not understanding the structure and logic of Github and the blogdown for configuration because I took a shortcut by googling and trials & errors and didn't feel like reading all the details of the Yihui's excellent [guidlines](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). If you are really new user as me and want to use some tips, this hopefully should be very useful. You can skip some of the dump hickups that you hopefully will not run into. :pray:

Here are the hickups that I ran into on Github, Blogdown and Netlify:

- Make sure your R and Rstudio version is up-to-date. [Here](https://bootstrappers.umassmed.edu/bootstrappers-courses/courses/rCourse/Additional_Resources/Updating_R.html) you can find how to update R and Rstudio.

- Steps of creating blogdown in Rstudio, github repo and Netlify

General steps Recommended:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

# define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish
node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen]
First [label =  '1. \n Create \n Github Repository']
Second [label = '2. \n Create R blogdown \n in R Studio']
Third [label= '3. \n Deploy the web \n by Netlify']

# edge definitions with the node IDs
First -> Second -> Third
}", height=150)
```
1. I highly recommend create a Github repository **before** you create blogdown as we have to use Github repo `<repo name>` to store all blogdown source files and deploy `_public_` folder by Netlify.Here is the steps that needs to pay attention when using Github:
    
  + Click the _Clone or download_ green button and copy URL
  + In Rstudio terminal **Change** directory to Github repo you just created `<repo name>` by using `cd <repo name>`, 
  + Run `git clone <GitHub URL>` to clone new repository

2. Build your blogdown in R Studio. I believe this step is easy to find either by watching R Studio video to get started or read the the part in the book by Yihui. You can refer to my previous blog about [change to your own logo](https://yuandu.netlify.com/2019/07/07/create-your-own-logo/). You should decide if you will use R markdown or Markdown for each blog.

  + A tip to select multiple items to commit is by `git add .`^[There is a space between "add" and "."] and `git commit -m "your message"` and `git push origion master` in the terminal.
  + Add a file for the post that contains pictures. To reference the picture from the post, a folder should be created under path `static/post`.
  + Sometimes the `Viewer` doesn't display the content. What worked for me is that I restart the R session and render my post with **`blogdown::serve_site()`** manually in the Console.
  + My post written by R markdown doesn't generate html file and then the blog coudln't be deployed. so by manually **Knit** to html to generate the file solved the problem.
  
3. Deploy the website on netlify for free requires below steps:

  + Create a netlify account by Github
  + Name your website in `config.toml` file under `baseurl =`. followed by the netlify domain `netlify.com`.Remember to have **backslash "/"** at the end. 
  + Add the build settings
  ![](/post/2019-07-12-create-and-pushlish-rblogdown-by-netlify_files/NetlifySet.png){width=800px height=600px}
  + check Hugo version `blogdown::hugo_version()`
