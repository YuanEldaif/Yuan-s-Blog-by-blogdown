      <description>Iâ€™m a noobie on using Github and Hugo. ðŸ˜Š It took me quite a while to figure out how to use version control on Github through Rstudio. In this blog, I would like to share my obstacles on publishing website to Github and deploy my website by Netflify. Some of the obstacles were caused by not understanding the structure and workflow of Github/Blogdown because I took a shortcut by googling and trials &amp;amp; errors and didnâ€™t have patience to read all the details of the Yihuiâ€™s excellent guidlines.</description>
