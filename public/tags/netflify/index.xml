      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a noobie on using Github and Hugo. ðŸ˜Š It took me quite a while to figure out how to use version control on Github through Rstudio. In this blog, I would like to share my hickhups on publishing website to Github and deploy my website by Netflify. Some of the hickhups were caused by not understanding the structure and logic of Github and the blogdown for configuration because I took a shortcut by googling and trials &amp;amp; errors and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like reading all the details of the Yihui&amp;rsquo;s excellent guidlines.</description>
