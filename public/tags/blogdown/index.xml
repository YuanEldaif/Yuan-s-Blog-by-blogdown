      <description>This is a test website for my very first blog by using R blogdown package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and customized by Yuan Du. You may find my name as Alice, Yoanna and last name as Eldaif as I recently got married.ðŸ™€ I know this is very confusingâ€¦
Iâ€™m a Biostatistician at AdventHealth in Orlando, FL. The more I work, the more I realize that I need to learn more statistics and data science.</description>
