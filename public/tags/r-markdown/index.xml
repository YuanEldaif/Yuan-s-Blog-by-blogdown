      <description>R MarkdownThe first time that I used R Markdown was back to 2014 when I was in grduate school. Unfortunately, I haven’t used this as much as I would like to due to the inconvinience with IT in the hospital. I’m slowling trying to use Rstudio more and more as SAS has limited options on some analysis. This will be great for documenting R code and math expressions.</description>
