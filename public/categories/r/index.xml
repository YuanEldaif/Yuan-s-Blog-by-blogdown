      <description>Thanks to the short course at SDSS 2019, I learned how to do tf-idf to topic modeling and sentiment analysis by using tidytext taught by Julia Silge, author of Text Mining with R and Mara Averick. They did a great job on teaching the four hour class. I didnâ€™t expect to have so much covered in the short course.
Here is an example that I used the method to analyze A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations by Charles Dickens by using sentiment analysis.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m a noobie on using Github and Hugo. ðŸ˜Š It took me quite a while to figure out how to use version control on Github through Rstudio. In this blog, I would like to share my obstacles on publishing website to Github and deploying my website by Netflify. Some of the obstacles were caused by not understanding the structure and workflow of Github/Blogdown because I took a shortcut by googling and trials &amp;amp; errors and didnâ€™t have patience to read all the details of the Yihuiâ€™s excellent guidelines.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownThe first time that I used R Markdown was back to 2014 when I was in graduate school. Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t used this as much as I would like to due to the inconvinience with IT in the hospital. Iâ€™m slowly trying to use Rstudio more and more as SAS has limited options on some analysis. R markdown is great for documenting R code and math expressions.</description>

      <description>This is a test website for my very first blog by using R blogdown package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and customized by Yuan Du. You may find my name as Alice, Yoanna and last name as Eldaif as I recently got married.ðŸ™€ I know this is very confusingâ€¦
Iâ€™m a Biostatistician at AdventHealth in Orlando, FL. The more I work, the more I realize that I need to learn more statistics and data science.</description>
