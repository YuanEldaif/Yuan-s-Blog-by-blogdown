      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a noobie on using Github and Hugo. ðŸ˜Š It took me quite a while to figure out how to use version control on Github through Rstudio. In this blog, I would like to share my hickhups on publishing website to Github and deploy my website by Netflify. Some of the hickhups were caused by not understanding the structure and logic of Github and the blogdown for configuration because I took a shortcut by googling and trials &amp;amp; errors and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like reading all the details of the guidlines.</description>

      <description>This is a test website for my blog by using R blogdown package. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yuan Du. You may find my name as Alice, Yoanna and last name as Eldaif as I recently got married.ðŸ™€ Sorry for so many names that causes confusions&amp;hellip;

      <description>R MarkdownThe first time that I used R Markdown was back to 2014 when I was in grduate school. Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t used this as much as I would like to due to the inconvinience with IT in the hospital. Iâ€™m slowling trying to use Rstudio more and more as SAS has limited options on some analysis. This will be great for documenting R code and math expressions.</description>
